# WBC-multiclass-classification-with-confusion-matrix-using-CNN
WBC or White Blood Cell constitutes of different component which plays a vital role in our body defense system. Here we have used Convolutional Neural Network to classify the 4 major components of WBC. Also the confusion matrix, accuracy curve and loss curve are also shown.

# Dataset Description
Here the BCCD dataset is used. The whole dataset was splitted into three categories, train, validation and test set. The model was trained on the train set and then the validation set was used to validate our model. The test shows us the accuracy our model performs on real world data.
